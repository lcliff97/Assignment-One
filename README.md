# Assignment-One

What requirements did you achieve?

- I believe I managed to wrap everything in the correct tags, even if some of them are not fully functional/I couldn't get additional styling of them to work. I included a navbar, a footer, had images that take up the viewport etc.

- I managed to use CSS 'absolute' positioning for my call to action boxes, and also managed to use 'stick' for my navbar and 'static' for my footer.

- With middling success I managed to use flex box, I understand in theory what it's used for, and is so far one of the main things I've come to understand over the course of last week, at least on a conceptual level. Implementation of flexbox has been a different thing altogether, despite understanding what it can be used for, I can't seem to orient things as I'd like, which I'll move onto later. Technically however, I did manage to apply flexboxes to my nav bar and social media icons in the footer.

- All images I used either used the correct src or I downloaded and implemented them via a folder.

Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

- All of the stretch goals with possibly the exception of using 'hover'. I did technically manage this but the effect elicited when hovering over the social media icons (that for some reason I could not have display in a row on the footer) is pitiful to say the least. There is a small background glow of gold, and a small increase in scale that I managed for the buttons. All other stretch goals I didn't even attempt as I've been pressed for time over the weekend.

If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

- Pretty much everything, I do understand HTML structure and also understand CSS at least in theory, and I understand how they relate to one another. However, the amount of functions they have is absolutely overwhelming at the moment, and what's worse is I don't understand the syntax for the code, I'm clearly doing many things wrong, but logically, it makes zero sense to me. I don't understand the phrasing I should be using when I'm attempting to create hover effects, change scaling, or flex certain elements without having them effect something else entirely.

- For reference, I wanted the navbar links to "flex end", each time I did this however the title of "Big Mick's Guitars" would cram itself with those links at the end of the navbar and I have no idea why.

- I couldn't make the social media icons disply next to one another on a row on the navbar despite trying numerous things, and even being aware flexbox automatically uses 'row' as the default axis of choice.

- I couldn't make the navbar fill the empty space at the top of the webpage.

- I couldn't prevent the CTA buttons from overlaying on top of the navbar, although I presume that's something to do with their absolute positioning.
